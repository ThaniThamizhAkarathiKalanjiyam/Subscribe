TASK:



Given the following sequence of events, determine whether each customer's account is paid in full, in a overdue state, or disabled. 

Customers can make one-off payments and set up recurring payments.

Billing date is the last day of the month if it falls Monday - Friday, otherwise if it falls on a weekend, then the date is the previous Friday.

Accounts are paid in arrears, i.e. if a customer subscribes to the service for January, then their account must be settled by the last day in January (given the above rule).

Accounts over 1 week but less than 2 months in arrears are flagged as overdue, 2 months and over are disabled.

Subscription costs £4.00 a month, but there is a £1.00 surcharge for making one-off payments. Consider today is the 31st July
